Project Title: On the Training of Generative Adversarial Nets

Team Members: Mingrui Liu, Xin Man

Project Idea

Standard Generative Adversarial Net (GAN) suffers from the instablity and failure to achieve convergence during the training phase. To address this issue, there are two common strategies. The first is to change the objective function in a smart way to make it easier to train while maintaining its the effectiveness, and another way is to utilize different optimization algorithms to accelerate the training procedure. In this project, we aim to investigate and design different approaches for training GANs based on the two strategies. Concretely, we target on following recent developments of different GANs, and investigate a variety of optimization algorithms to facilitate efficient training.
